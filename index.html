					Our omakase menu is $220 per person, inclusive of tax and service but not additional beverage.  Reservations are made through Tock, our online reservation system.

					For your enjoyment and the enjoyment of our guests:<br/>
					<br/>
					1) Please arrive on time. Everyone at the sushi bar is served at the same time, so like a movie, the show will start whether you’re present or not. Late arrivals will be coursed out of their meal. If you are arriving late, shoot us a text message.<br/>
					<br/>
					2) Please refrain from wearing stong perfume/cologne, as it can very much distract from the food and those around you. (This most often applies to men wearing strong cologne)<br/>
					<br/>
					3) Please be kind and courteous. Every seat is a sushi bar seat in which people are served at the same time, so our restaurant can become very communal.  Let's be nice to each other and make friends! <br/>
					<br/>
					4) We cannot accommodate serious gluten allergies and celiac disease as we cannot guarantee zero cross contamination because of the way the food is prepared. For those that are gluten sensitive, the only items that will contain wheat is a very small amount in our soy sauce. <br/>
					<br/>
					5) We predominantly serve sushi, not sashimi.  Since rice plays such a large role in our menu, we cannot accommodate those that cannot eat rice.

				<div id="about-title"><h1>About</h1></div>
				<p class="about-par">						
					Kyōten (kee-oh-ten) is a reservation-only, omakase sushi restaurant that approaches sushi as a discipline based on the values purity, harmony, and balance.  Fish are sourced predominantly from Japan and fine-tuned through various techniques.  Edomae sushi influences such as aging, curing, and marinating are used to create layers of depth, complexity, and umami.  While grounded in Edomae tradition, Kyōten is a modern sushi restaurant with modern sensibilities.
				</p>
				<p class="about-par">
					Shari (sushi rice) plays a central role in our sushi philosophy.  Kyōten uses a very special and exclusive varietal of rice from Japan called Inochi no Ichi, the first (and currently only) restaurant in the US to use this paricular grain.  Our shari is boldly seasoned with the intense taste of aged red vinegar.  Different rice recipes are used so that they pair fittingly with different kinds of fish. 
				</p>
				<p class="about-par">
					Unity and togetherness between fish and rice is fundamental to our beliefs and values.  The two should be like lovers with a sense of deep belonging to each other.  This is what makes good sushi and is what drives our menu in all aspects: taste, timing, order, menu format and context.  We serve simple things in the moment.
				</p>
				<p class="about-par">
					Otto first learned his craft under Tatsu Aikawa and Tako Matsumoto, before the two opened Austin’s celebrated restaurant, Ramen Tatsuya.  He later traveled and worked in various other restaurants including Nobu NY/Nobu 57, Masa/Bar Masa, and Uchi/Uchiko.  Opening his flaghip restaurant in the beautiful city of Chicago is his next venture.
